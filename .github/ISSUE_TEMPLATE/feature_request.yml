        # Thank you for opening a feature request.

        The [OpenTofu Language Server](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu-ls) issue tracker is reserved for bug reports relating to the OpenTofu Language Server repository.
        We use GitHub issues for tracking bugs and enhancements.
        For questions, please use [the community slack](https://opentofucommunity.slack.com/archives/C08Q08C6H88) where there are more people ready to help.

        In order to make your feature request a success, here are some simple tips to follow:

        1. Try to describe what you need to achieve rather than how you would like to change.
        2. Be as specific as possible. Overarching large changes to OpenTofu have a lower chance of getting accepted than specific changes.
        3. Describe how it affects your current project specifically. Try to support it with specific code and describe why the current situation is unsatisfactory.

        In order to properly evaluate a feature request, it is necessary to understand the use cases for it.
        Please describe below the _end goal_ you are trying to achieve that has led you to request this feature.
        Please keep this section focused on the problem and not on the suggested solution. We'll get to that in a moment, below!

        If you've already tried to solve the problem with existing features and found a limitation that prevented you from succeeding, please describe it below in as much detail as possible.
        Ideally, this would include real configuration snippets that you tried, actions you performed (e.g. autocompletion in a particular position in that snippet), and what results you got in each case.
        Please remove any sensitive information such as passwords before sharing configuration snippets.

        If you have an idea for a way to address the problem via a change to existing features, please describe it below.
        In this section, it's helpful to include specific examples of how what you are suggesting might look in configuration files, or on the command line, since that allows us to understand the full picture of what you are proposing.
        If you're not sure of some details, don't worry! When we evaluate the feature request we may suggest modifications as necessary to work within the design constraints of the Language Server.
