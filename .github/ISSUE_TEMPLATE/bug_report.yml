        # Thank you for opening an issue.

        The [OpenTofu Language Server](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu-ls) issue tracker is reserved for bug reports relating to the OpenTofu Language Server repository.
        We use GitHub issues for tracking bugs and enhancements.
        For questions, please use [the community slack](https://opentofucommunity.slack.com/archives/C08Q08C6H88) where there are more people ready to help.

        ## Filing a bug report

        To fix problems, we need clear reproduction cases - we need to be able to see it happen locally. A reproduction case is ideally something any engineer can git-clone or copy-paste and run immediately, without inventing any details or context.

        * A short example can be directly copy-pasteable; longer examples should be in separate git repositories, especially if multiple files are needed
        * Please include all needed context. For example, if you figured out that an expression can cause a crash, put the expression in a variable definition or a resource
        * Set defaults on (or omit) any variables. The person reproducing it should not need to invent variable settings
        * Omit any unneeded complexity: remove variables, conditional statements, functions, etc. that are not needed to trigger the bug
